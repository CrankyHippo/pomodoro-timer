# Pomodoro Timer Project

This was my first project utilizing React. Inside of the "unbuilt" folder I've uploaded the files I used to complete the project.

## Description 

The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

### Project Goal 

To implement a simplified version of Cirillo's original Pomodoro technique. Designed to test your ability to work with rendering and state management using React. This project skills included the following:

* Installing packages via NPM.
* Running tests from the command line.
* Writing React function components.
* Using hooks like useState()
* Debugging React code through console output

This application uses [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and [Open-Iconic](https://useiconic.com/open) icons for icons.
