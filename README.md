# Pomodoro Timer Project

This was my first project utilizing React. Inside of the "unbuilt" folder I've uploaded the files I used to complete the project.
[My Pomodoro Timer Page](https://crankyhippo.github.io/pomodoro-timer/).

## Description 

The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. 

### Project Goal 

To implement a simplified version of Cirillo's original Pomodoro technique.
